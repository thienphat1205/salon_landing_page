            desc="The concept of dipping powders is simple. Our technicians apply an adhesive base which is dipped in fine colored powder. The nail is then sealed with a special top coat. There are multiple aesthetic benefits of getting Dipping Powder. It is more durable yet more flexible than traditional acrylics, and the powder provides more strength than many gels. Unlike Gel Polish, Dipping Powder doesn't require UV lights to bond it to the nail. You can maintain the nails for as long as you like, although we recommend redo every two to three weeks depending on your lifestyle and the care of your nails."
